# Prove discovery before a live run

Start a fresh Codex agent from the repository root after installation. Require its provided skill catalog to list `agent-workflows`, invoke `$agent-workflows`, and confirm it can read this contract. Preserve the catalog and contract-read report as readiness evidence. Filesystem presence alone is not discovery proof. Do not use the production application for this check.
